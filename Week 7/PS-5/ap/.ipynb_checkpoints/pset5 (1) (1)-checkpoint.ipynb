    "\n",
    "As usual, you are highly encouraged to *start this problem set early!*  My best guess (no guarantees!) is that Part 1 will be conceptually easy but perhaps time consuming.  Parts 2 and 3 are medium difficult, but there are plenty of opportunities to get confused with python data structures, so if you're going to get stuck, get stuck (and unstuck) early! Part 4 will give you an opportunity to get some intuition with PCA.\n",

    "## Introduction to the assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll be analyzing movie reviews in an attempt to determine whether movies are good or bad.  I've downloaded a large number of movie reviews from the [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com) website, which are available in the file \"reviews.csv\" on Canvas.  I've also put a file \"movies.dat\" on Canvas that contains metadata for ~65,000 different movies\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've never seen Rotten Tomatoes before, go spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the website.  It's a meta-review website that aggregates movie reviews from a large number of critics.  Here's what the page for this year's likely [Oscar winner](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_revenant_2015/) looks like.  Note in particular the section on \"Critic Reviews\" at the bottom -- that's the content that has been scraped and put in the reviews.csv file.  Also note that each movie is given a quantitative score on the Tomatometer which is used to classify the movie as either Fresh (good) or Rotten (bad).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission is to develop a classifier to determine whether a movie is Fresh or Rotten based on the contents of the reviews given to the movie.  As usual, we'll start out with some exploratory data analysis."

    "### 1.4 Ratings over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `movies` dataset, create a plot that shows how the average rating per movie (rtAllCriticsRating) has evolved over time.  Do this by creating a scatterplot where the x-axis is the year in which the movie was released and the y-axis is rtAllCriticsRating.  Drop movies with 0 or unknown values to avoid biasing your results.  Then, create a scatterplot that has one <year,rating> point for each remaining movie, and pick an appropriate size/color/transparency for these points to ensure that the graph looks professional.  In other words, do not simply use the default settings, as this will produce a dense mess of dots that will be hard to interpret.  Finally, overlay on this scatterplot a line graph in orange showing how the average movie rating (the average of rtAllCriticsRating across all movies in a year) has changed over time.  Do you notice a trend?  What do you think it means?"

Now, using your training data, fit a regression of median housing price on this first principal component of your data.  Report the RMSE of this regression for both the training and test set.  How do these results compare to your results from 4.1?  Interpret your results!"
